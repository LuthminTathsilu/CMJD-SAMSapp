# Student Attendence Management System
## Overview 


Student Attendance Management System (SAMS) is a desktop-based application developed using JavaFX and MySQL with a layered architecture (Controller → Service → DAO). It is designed to help educational institutes efficiently manage and monitor student attendance records across multiple courses and lectures.

This system provides functionalities for administrators or staff to:

Add and manage student, lecturer, course, and subject data.

Schedule lectures (classes) and mark attendance.

View, search, and update attendance records.

Ensure reliable data access and integrity using database transactions.

The system emphasizes clean separation of concerns by using DTOs, Entities, Services, and DAOs, making it maintainable and scalable.
## SetUp Instructions

MySQL Server (8.0 recommended)

JavaFX SDK (if not using an IDE that includes it)

IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)

MySQL Workbench or command line (optional for DB management)

## Technologies

JavaFX – For creating the graphical user interface (GUI)
